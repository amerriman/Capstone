[Live site!](https://writone.herokuapp.com/)

WriTone uses the MEAN stack and RESTful routing, combined with the power of the Watson Alchemy API to help teachers and student analyze the tone of their writing. 'Teacher' users main dashboard view showcases NV.D3 charts and responsive design that allows for an intuitive user experience. 'Student' users see a simplified dashboard with access to edit and delete their writing submissions, as well as view NV.D3 charts to track their own performance. Basic analysis functionality persists for non-logged in users.
